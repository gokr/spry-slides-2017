# Sprylang and Odd Ideas in Language Design

Slides used to present at GDG Meetup December 2017 in Stockholm, slightly revised afterwards.

Abstract:

Implementing your own programming language opens up opportunities to experiment in directions that may be fun, clever or downright idiotic. When designing Spry, which is still evolving, I am trying to find new ways to do things - even for the most established mechanisms. Obviously, because it's interesting and fun, but also because most programming languages are stuck in the-way-it-has-always-been-done-must-be-best. In this presentation I will show some of these ideas in Spry, what they were inspired from and hopefully open up a dialog about the need for language evolution and broadening of our views on how a programming language must work.
